HTML Project List

1.Project One: Feedback Form for Engineering Faculty

   This project is a feedback form designed specifically for students to provide valuable input on their academic experience with engineering faculty. It serves as a medium for students to express their opinions on various aspects of teaching, course materials, faculty engagement, and accessibility outside of regular class hours.

  Styling:
  
  -Background Image: The form is styled with an antique white background overlaid with the project logo for visual appeal.
  -Container Layout: Utilizes flexbox to create a responsive and visually appealing form elements that include university logo and form heading.
  -Interactive Elements: Incorporates CSS transitions to add subtle hover effects, enhancing the user experience.
  
2. Project Title: My Daraz Clone - HTML & CSS 

Description:

I have created "Daraz Clone". This project is my own version of the popular Daraz platform, built using HTML and CSS. It's a simple and formal representation of my coding skills. I tried my best to incorporate all those components in this project that are there in the real website to practice and polish my front-end skills.

New Exploration:

To enhance user interaction, the project incorporates dynamic animations. The front picture undergoes a skew animation in a loop, adding a subtle visual interest. Additionally, a disappearing Daraz logo animation creates a unique effect on the page, contributing to an overall modern and engaging design.
